# Dice

A simple program for simulating dice throws.

The buttons on the left of the interface add dice to the hand while the buttons on the right remove dice.

Hitting the roll button (default F12) rolls the dice in the hand.

The roll button can be remapped by clicking the button in the bottom right of the UI.
